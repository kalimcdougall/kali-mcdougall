**Hello! I'm Kali 😺**

I study glaciology ❄️ climatology 🌧️ and remote sensing 🛰️ at the University of Victoria ☃️ I am currently using satellites and space lasers 👾 to look at ice shelves in Antarctica!

  I am usually writing code, doing various outdoor activities, or playing video games with my cat.
