**Hello! I'm Kali 🐸**

I study polar science at the University of Victoria ☃️ I use satellites and space lasers 👾 to look at ice shelves in Antarctica!

  I am passionate about glaciology ❄️ climatology 🌧️ and remote sensing 🛰️

  I am usually writing code, doing various outdoor activities, or playing video games with my cat
